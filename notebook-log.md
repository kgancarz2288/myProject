## Phylogenetic Project: Turtle Phylogenomics
**Dataset:** Crawford et al. (2015) - [10.5061/dryad.t77q4](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t77q4)
This data consists of 2,381 UCE loci from 38 taxa. It was used to resolve the placement of turtles wiithin the vertebrate tree of of life

## Data Stage and QC Plan
- **Current Stage:** Assembled and aligned UCEs
- **QC Tool:** **Phyluce**
- **Plan:** I will use 'phyluce' to check alignment lengths and taxon completedness since the raw reads have already been processed into alignements by the original authors
